## Week Overview

Welcome to Week 9, where we take a deep dive into "Characterizing Your Problem Statement." Building upon the valuable insights gained in previous lessons, we will now focus on crafting your problem statement. This week is all about bringing clarity, precision, and depth to your understanding of the issues you aim to address.

In this week's lesson, you'll revisit your identified core problem and explore how to define it with utmost clarity and precision. We'll examine techniques for identifying key dimensions, understanding constraints, and assessing potential impact areas. By the end of the week, you'll emerge with a problem statement that is not only well-defined but also imbued with an understanding of its various dimensions, constraints, and potential impact areas.

As we navigate these concepts, we'll engage in practical exercises to strengthen your problem characterization skills. These abilities are crucial for crafting effective solutions and contributing to broader global goals, aligning with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. Let's dive into the world of problem characterization, building upon the strong foundation from Lesson 8
