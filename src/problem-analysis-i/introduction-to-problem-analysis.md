Now, let's explore problem analysis together.

As we learn from Zig Ziglar’s famous quote, "The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist." But recognizing the existence of a problem is just the beginning. In lesson 5, we focused on identifying problems, which is the initial step in the problem-solving journey. Problem analysis, as we'll discover, takes us a step further in understanding and addressing these issues.

**So what exactly is Problem Analysis?**

In simple terms, ***problem analysis is the systematic approach to understanding an issue or challenge, breaking it down into its constituent parts, and examining these components to gain insights.***

It starts with breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable bits. Think of it as disassembling a complex puzzle. Once you've got these pieces in front of you, it's time to put on your detective hat and examine each one carefully. This is where the magic happens, and insights emerge.

Here are some notable definitions of problem analysis:

> “Problem analysis is a series of steps for identifying problems, analyzing them, and developing solutions to address them. It's an inquiry or investigation into the causes of an error, failure, or unexpected incident.”
**- Indeed.com**
>

> “It involves identifying the overriding problem and establishing the causes and effects related to that problem.”
**- Richard Freed**
>

> “Problem analysis is the process of understanding real-world problems and user’s needs and proposing solutions to meet those needs. The goal of problem analysis is to gain a better understanding of the problem being solved before developing a solution.”
**- BusinessAnalystMentor.com**
>

The definitions we've seen all emphasize a few key ideas. First, they stress the importance of **understanding the problem**. This means really knowing what the problem is, **what causes it, and what it leads to**. Second, they highlight the need to **break the problem into smaller parts** and look at each part closely. Lastly, they all talk about **finding solutions to solve the problem**. This means figuring out ways to fix it and deciding if those ways will actually work.

From the video, we learn that problem analysis is a systematic process that involves several steps:

1. **Formulating the starter problem:** This involves identifying the main issue that needs to be addressed.
2. **Zeroing in on the starter problem:** This means defining the problem more precisely and understanding its scope.
3. **Identifying direct causes:** This involves asking "Why?" repeatedly to get to the root of the problem.
4. **Identifying direct effects:** This means understanding the consequences of the problem.
5. **Exploring indirect effects:** This means looking at the ripple effects of the problem.
6. **Reviewing and analyzing:** This means making sure that all of the causes and effects are understood.
7. **Drawing the lines:** This means creating a visual representation of the cause-effect relationships.
8. **Ensuring completeness:** This means making sure that all of the possible causes and effects have been considered.

Problem analysis is a dynamic tool that equips development practitioners with the insights they need to drive meaningful change.

## Why is Problem Analysis Important?

Problem analysis is a critical step in the process of solving problems. It involves identifying the root causes of a problem so that effective solutions can be developed.

A good problem analysis can help to:

1. **Identify the real problem.** Often, the symptoms of a problem are more obvious than the underlying causes. Problem analysis can help to uncover the root causes of a problem so that effective solutions can be developed.
2. **Determine the scope of the problem.** Problem analysis can help to determine the size and complexity of a problem.
3. **Identify the stakeholders.** Problem analysis can help to identify the people who are affected by a problem. This is important for ensuring that the solutions are designed to meet the needs of all stakeholders.
4. **Develop effective solutions.** Problem analysis can help to develop solutions that address the root causes of a problem. Addressing root causes leads to sustainable, long-lasting solutions.
5. **Improve decision-making.** By understanding the root causes of a problem, decision-makers can make more informed decisions about how to address it.
6. **Save time and money.** By identifying and addressing the root causes of a problem, we can avoid spending time and money on solutions that only address the symptoms.
7. **Build consensus.** By involving stakeholders in the problem analysis process, we can build consensus on the best way to address the problem.

## Meet Tobi

> Tobi is a brilliant computer science student known for solving complex coding puzzles. He was excited to start a new project with his team to develop a cutting-edge software application. They had a clear goal: to create a user-friendly app for organizing study materials.
>
> As they began working, Tobi noticed something peculiar. Many users were complaining about the app's slow performance and frequent crashes. Initially, they attributed these issues to minor bugs and tried fixing them. However, despite their efforts, the problems persisted.
>
> One day, during a team meeting, Tobi raised a critical question, "Are these bugs or symptoms of a deeper problem?"
> 
> His teammates exchanged puzzled looks. "What do you mean?" one of them asked.
>
> Tobi explained, "Let's use problem analysis. We should investigate to understand whether these issues are just symptoms or if there's an underlying root cause."
>
> The team decided to follow Tobi's lead. They started by identifying the symptoms - app crashes and slow performance. Then, they delved deeper to uncover the real problem: inefficient code architecture that couldn't handle the growing database of study materials.
>
> Here's what they learned from this experience:
> 
> 1. **Identify the Real Problem**: They realized that the symptoms they were addressing were just the tip of the iceberg. Problem analysis helped them unearth the actual root cause.
>
> 2. **Determine the Scope**: Problem analysis enabled them to assess the extent of the issue. They understood that the problem wasn't limited to a few users; it affected all their users.
>
> 3. **Recognize Stakeholders**: By examining the problem thoroughly, they identified the users as stakeholders. Their app's performance directly impacted these users.
>
> 4. D**evelop Effective Solutions**: Armed with the knowledge of the root cause, they redesigned their app's architecture from the ground up, resulting in a more stable and efficient product.
