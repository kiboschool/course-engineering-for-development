# Frameworks for Evaluating Existing Solutions

Evaluation frameworks are structured approaches that guide the evaluation process. We'll explore common frameworks like Logic Models, Theory of Change, and Results-Based Management. These Frameworks not only help in organizing your evaluation process but also clarify the relationships between inputs, outputs, outcomes, and impacts.

It's important to note that evaluation often goes hand in hand with monitoring, forming the well-known term 'monitoring and evaluation.'

> ðŸ“º Gain deeper insights into this through David Hearle's video on the significance of monitoring and evaluation frameworks, enhancing your understanding of their pivotal role.

There are several frameworks used for evaluating existing solutions, but in this course, we will focus on four of them:

- Logical Models
- Theory of Change
- Utilization-Focused Evaluation (UFE)
- Social Return on Investment (SROI)

## Logic Models

Logic models offer a visual representation of the logical sequence of events in a program or intervention. They outline the relationship between inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts. Logic models help in clarifying the connections between program components and their expected results, aiding in evaluation.

> ðŸ“º Watch the Institute of Education video on Logic models to better understand how the framework works.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxkWpBqNFp4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

From the video, we learn that a logic model comprises several key components that collectively create a comprehensive understanding of the program:

**Problem Statement:** This succinctly describes the issue the program aims to address.

**Resources, Activities, and Outputs**: These elements define the program's structure and operational processes.

**Short-Term, Mid-Term, and Long-Term Outcomes**: These outcomes highlight what the program aims to achieve at different points in its implementation.

## Theory of Change

This framework focuses on understanding the underlying theories and assumptions that guide a program. It involves mapping out the cause-and-effect relationships between activities, outcomes, and impacts of an intervention. Theory of Change helps in framing evaluations by identifying key milestones and potential areas for measurement.

> ðŸ“º Watch Jan Brouwers, a Senior Advisor at the Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation, give an introductory overview of the Theory of Change in this video.

In the video, Jan explains that theory of change can serve as a blueprint that answers the fundamental questions:

- **What We Want to Achieve:** The Theory of Change outlines your ultimate vision, articulating the change you aspire to bring about.
- **How We Can Achieve It:** It delves into the strategies and steps necessary to transform your vision into reality.
- **Why We Want to Achieve It:** It sheds light on the motivations and driving factors behind your quest for change.

> ðŸ“º Watch Chris Gaines, the lead trainer at SoPact provide an exploration of ToC from a social entrepreneurial perspective in this video.

Chris asserts that creating a robust Theory of Change is a critical step in establishing an impactful strategy for any social or environmental purpose organization. By laying out the roadmap from impact to resources, the framework guides decisions, enhances accountability, and streamlines efforts.

## Utilization-Focused Evaluation (UFE)

This approach prioritizes the needs and perspectives of the intended users of the evaluation. It focuses on ensuring that evaluation findings are useful and relevant to decision-makers. Utilization-focused evaluation tailors the evaluation process to meet the specific needs of stakeholders.

> ðŸ“º Learn more about the utilization-focused evaluation framework in this video.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-ZX3L6qKtc?si=5lLJDrmH4IQQpYtk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

The UFE model positions the evaluator as a facilitator of evaluative decision-making for those who will actually use the evaluation results. This shift in perspective ensures that evaluations are not only a measure of success for funders but also provide valuable insights to program staff, administrators, and the community.

## Social Return on Investment (SROI)

SROI is a framework that quantifies the social value generated by a program or intervention. It involves assessing not only the direct outcomes but also the wider societal impacts. SROI assigns a monetary value to these impacts, offering a holistic perspective on evaluation.

> ðŸ“º Watch this Social Change video explaining the concept.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGrIeVcfn_M?si=ZN19EX_RjGw9bpK1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

From the video, we learn that SROI is a framework that allows entrepreneurs and organizations to gauge the social, economic, and environmental value they create or diminish through their actions. It enables an in-depth understanding of the repercussions of their work on diverse aspects of society.

> ðŸ“– Also read BetterEvaluation [article](https://www.betterevaluation.org/methods-approaches/approaches/social-return-investment) on SROI for a better understanding of how the framework works.

The article highlights The Social Return on Investment (SROI) framework involves several interrelated steps:

1. **Defining Scope and Objectives:** Selecting a specific project scope, such as geographic area and timeframe.
2. **Identifying Stakeholders:** Identifying key actors who are influenced by or influence the project or solution.
3. **Developing Theory of Change:** Collaboratively creating a plan with stakeholders, detailing the intended outcomes and how they will be achieved.
4. **Inputs and Outputs:** Identifying investments and costs linked to each outcome, including unintended outcomes.
5. **Valuation:** Assigning a monetary value to benefits and costs using various methods.
6. **Calculating SROI Ratio:** Comparing inputs to financial, social, and environmental returns to calculate the SROI ratio.
7. **Narratives:** Incorporating stories and context alongside the ratio to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
8. **Verification:** Ensuring data accuracy through triangulation and validation.

These stages guide the creation of an SROI report, fostering communication among stakeholders and driving ongoing improvement of the project or initiative.

> ðŸªž Reflection: Imagine you have been invited to evaluate a project that was promoting eco-friendly practices in your neighborhood. How could you apply the SROI framework to assess the impact of the initiative?. Share your creative ideas on Padlet.
