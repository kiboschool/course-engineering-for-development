## Week Overview

In lesson 6, you learned the fundamentals of problem analysis, which are crucial for our next phase. This week, Problem Analysis II focuses on case studies from Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) concerning clean water and sanitation for all.

During this weekâ€™s lesson, you'll learn how to apply problem analysis skills to dissect complex issues related to SDG 6. Through case studies, you'll practice identifying root causes, understanding interconnected challenges, and proposing sustainable solutions.

As you engage with these case studies, you'll see how problem analysis becomes a practical tool for addressing global issues. Your grasp of interconnectedness and root cause identification will be invaluable as you work toward innovative solutions.

This week bridges theory and practice, allowing you to apply your problem analysis knowledge to real-world challenges. Let's use the foundations from Week 6 to explore problem analysis within the context of sustainable development.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the challenges of providing access to safe water and sanitation in developing countries.
- Apply the concepts of problem analysis to the water and sanitation sector.
- Identify the root causes of water and sanitation problems.
