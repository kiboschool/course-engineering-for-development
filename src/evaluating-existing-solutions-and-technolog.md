## Week Overview

Hello! Welcome to this lesson on evaluating existing solutions and technological innovation for development.Â  In the previous week, we delved into the fundamental concepts of sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We discussed the importance of addressing global challenges to achieve a more equitable and sustainable world. Building on this foundation, in this lesson, we will dive deeper into the practical aspects of making progress towards these goals.

While Week 2 provided us with a broad understanding of the SDGs, Week 3 will equip you with the frameworks to evaluate existing solutions critically, ensuring they align with the principles of sustainable development. Let's get started!

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Critically analyze the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions.
- Identify gaps and potential improvements in development interventions.
- Evaluate and select appropriate technologies based on contextual considerations.
