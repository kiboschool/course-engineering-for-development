## Week Overview

Last week, we covered the critical aspects of evaluating existing solutions, assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of interventions, and exploring innovative technological approaches to development challenges.

Building on the knowledge gained from last week, Week 4 takes a deeper dive into systems thinking and complexity. In this lesson, you will explore how these concepts provide valuable insights into understanding and addressing complex development issues. By understanding the intricacies of systems and their interconnectedness, you can better grasp the root causes of complex problems and formulate holistic solutions.

In essence, while Week 3 equipped you with the tools to assess and evaluate existing interventions, this week will empower you to take a step back, consider the bigger picture, and approach development challenges with a more comprehensive and interconnected perspective. These understandings will guide you in future lessons.

Letâ€™s get started!

## Learning outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Define systems thinking and understand its underlying principles
- Apply systems thinking principles to understand the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental factors in complex development issues.
- Evaluate the implications of systems thinking in addressing development challenges, considering the potential impacts of interventions on the broader system
