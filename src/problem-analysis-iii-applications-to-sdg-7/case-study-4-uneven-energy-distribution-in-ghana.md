# Case Study 4: Uneven Energy Distribution In Ghana

**Background:** Ghana, a country located on the Atlantic Ocean and bordered by Togo, Cote d'Ivoire, and Burkina Faso, has a population of approximately 29.6 million people. Over the past few decades, Ghana has experienced significant economic growth, driven by the production and export of cocoa, gold, and oil. However, this growth has not been evenly distributed, leading to various challenges, including uneven energy distribution.

Ghana's energy sector faces the challenge of uneven distribution, with some regions and communities having better access to reliable and affordable energy services than others. This disparity in energy distribution has several negative impacts on the country's economy, social development, and environmental sustainability:

- **Economic Impact:** Uneven energy distribution hinders economic growth and investment opportunities in regions with limited access to reliable and affordable energy. This disparity also affects the competitiveness of businesses, as those in areas with inadequate energy supply may face higher production costs and lower productivity.
- **Social Impact:** Communities with limited access to energy services, particularly electricity, face challenges in areas such as education, healthcare, and communication. Uneven energy distribution can also contribute to social inequality, as individuals and households in underserved areas may struggle to meet their basic needs and participate fully in economic and social activities.
- **Environmental Impact:** Inadequate energy distribution can lead to overreliance on traditional and inefficient energy sources, such as biomass and kerosene, in underserved areas. This reliance on unsustainable energy sources contributes to deforestation, indoor air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and its associated impacts.

To analyze the energy challenge in Ghana, we will conduct a **Pareto analysis**.

## Pareto Analysis for Uneven Energy Distribution in Ghana

### Step 1: Identify and List the Problems

In this step, we identify and list the problems related to uneven energy distribution in Ghana:

- **Some possible answers**
    1. Limited access to reliable and affordable energy in certain regions.
    2. Hindrance to economic growth and investment opportunities in underserved areas.
    3. Reduced competitiveness of businesses due to higher production costs.
    4. Impediments in education, healthcare, and communication in communities with limited energy access.
    5. Exacerbation of social inequality.
    6. Environmental issues such as deforestation, indoor air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions

### Step 2: Collect Data and Measure Impact

To perform Pareto analysis effectively, we need data to quantify the impact of each problem. This could involve gathering statistics on energy access in different regions, economic growth rates, production costs for businesses, educational and healthcare outcomes, social inequality indices, and environmental data.

*Task 1: Gather statistics on the following list of energy-related problems in Ghana*

- Limited access to reliable and affordable energy in certain regions.
- Hindrance to economic growth and investment opportunities in underserved areas.
- Reduced competitiveness of businesses due to higher production costs.
- Impediments in education, healthcare, and communication in communities with limited energy access.
- Exacerbation of social inequality.
- Environmental issues such as deforestation, indoor air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions.

### Step 3: Rank the Problems by Impact

Using the data collected, we rank the problems by their impact. The problems with the most substantial negative consequences are given higher ranks.

*Task 2: Rank the problems shared in (Task 1) by their impact.*

>❓ Share your ranking and ranking rationales in the padlet below.*

### Step 4: Calculate the Cumulative Impact

Next, we calculate the cumulative impact of the ranked problems. This involves adding up the impacts, starting from the problem with the highest rank and moving down the list. The cumulative impact helps us identify the critical few issues that contribute significantly to the overall challenge.

### Step 5: Identify the Vital Few Issues

The vital few issues are those that, when addressed, can lead to significant improvements in the situation. These are typically the top 20% of problems that contribute to 80% of the negative impact.

>❓ Which issues do you think are the vital few that drive 80% of the negative impact? Share your thoughts in the padlet below.

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/1y3edevonda3bf3c" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:608px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

### Step 6: Develop Solutions

Once the vital few issues are identified, we can focus our efforts on developing solutions that target these specific problems. For instance, addressing limited access to reliable and affordable energy in underserved regions may involve investing in infrastructure development and renewable energy projects. Reducing the environmental impact could entail promoting sustainable energy sources and conservation practices.

### Step 7: Implement and Monitor

Implement the solutions developed in step 6 and continuously monitor their effectiveness. This involves tracking key performance indicators related to energy distribution, economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. Adjust the solutions as needed to ensure progress toward a more evenly distributed energy system in Ghana.

It is helpful to note that following the Pareto analysis process enables you to identify and prioritize the critical issues related to uneven energy distribution in Ghana. The method allows us to allocate resources and efforts efficiently, addressing the problems that have the most substantial negative impact first. Ultimately, this approach can lead to more balanced and equitable energy access in the country, benefiting its economy, society, and environment.
