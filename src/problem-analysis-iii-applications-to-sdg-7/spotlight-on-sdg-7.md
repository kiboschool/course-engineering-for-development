SDG 7, or Affordable and Clean Energy, is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations back in 2015. Its mission? To ensure that by 2030, everyone has access to energy that's not just affordable but also clean, reliable, and sustainable.

Now, you might wonder, why's this such a big deal? Well, that's what we're going to dig into. You see, energy isn't just about turning on the lights or filling up your car. It's the power behind almost everything we do, from cooking our meals to running our industries.

Energy is crucial for development, but billions of people still lack access to modern energy services. Additionally, much of the energy we use comes from fossil fuels like coal and oil, which harm the environment. It's like trying to solve one problem while creating another. That's where SDG 7 comes in: it's all about finding ways to make energy available for everyone while protecting the planet.

From the video, we learn that clean energy is a term used to describe energy derived from renewable, zero-emission sources that do not pollute the atmosphere during usage. Clean energy is distinct from two other related energy terms: Green energy and Renewable energy.

## Clean Energy vs. Green Energy vs. Renewable Energy

It’s important to distinguish between these three types of energy.

**Clean Energy:** Clean energy is sourced from energy providers that do not release air pollutants when generating power. It aims to minimize environmental impact and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In essence, clean energy promotes a healthier planet. Examples of clean energy include;

- Solar energy
- Wind energy
- Hydropower
- Geothermal energy

**Renewable Energy:** This type of energy is generated from sources that are continually replenished, ensuring a sustainable supply. These sources, such as wind, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, biomass and tidal energy in contrast with finite fossil fuels like oil and gas.

**Green energy,** on the other hand, is energy derived from natural sources, often referred to as "green" because they are eco-friendly. However, it's important to note that not all renewable energy sources are considered green due to potential environmental drawbacks. Examples of green energy include;

- Biomass energy (such as wood and biofuels)
- Solar energy
- Wind energy
- Hydropower

As you can see, there is a significant overlap between clean energy, green energy, and renewable energy. Many renewable energy sources are also considered clean and green energy.

The terms clean energy, green energy, and renewable energy are often used interchangeably, but it is important to be aware of the differences between them. Clean energy is energy that does not release air pollutants, while green energy is energy that is derived from natural sources. Renewable energy is energy that is generated from sources that are continually replenished.

Now that you understand what clean energy is, let’s focus on SDG7.

## Sustainable Development Goal 7

SDG 7 is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations to address global issues. It specifically focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufwA6At6LvQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

SDG 7 comprises five distinct targets, each designed to address different aspects of the global energy challenge:

### 1. Universal Access to Energy

**Target 7.1:** By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services.

This target aims to eradicate energy poverty, ensuring that everyone on the planet has access to electricity and clean cooking facilities. Currently, millions of people lack basic access to energy, hampering their development opportunities.

### 2. Increase Renewable Energy

**Target 7.2:** By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.

This target focuses on transitioning to cleaner energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower. Reducing reliance on fossil fuels not only mitigates climate change but also promotes sustainable energy production.

### 3. Double the Rate of Improvement in Energy Efficiency

**Target 7.3:** By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

Improving energy efficiency is a powerful way to reduce energy consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and save costs. This target encourages technological advancements and better practices in energy use.

### 4. Expand Infrastructure and Technology for Sustainable Energy

**Target 7.A:** By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

Collaborative efforts and technology transfer are crucial to make sustainable energy solutions accessible worldwide. Developing nations need support to build the infrastructure for clean energy production and distribution.

### 5. Increase Investment in Energy

**Target 7.B:** By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, particularly least developed countries, small island developing States, and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programs of support.

Adequate financial support is essential to realizing SDG 7's goals, especially in regions facing unique challenges like small island nations and least developed countries. Investment helps build the necessary infrastructure and technologies for sustainable energy.

## Why is SDG 7 important?

SDG 7 addresses several pressing issues, with a primary focus on energy accessibility and sustainability. Here are some key points that underscore the significance of this goal:

1. **Energy Access**: Shockingly, one in five people still lacks access to modern electricity. This lack of access hampers economic growth, education, and overall well-being.
2. **Climate Change:** Energy production accounts for approximately sixty percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor to climate change. This highlights the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions.

Energy, in its various forms, is the lifeblood of modern society. It powers our homes, fuels transportation, drives industry, and underpins many critical services. Access to clean and affordable energy is not only a development goal in itself but also an enabler of other SDGs. Clean energy is essential for combating climate change, supporting economic growth, and improving health and education.

SDG 7, Affordable and Clean Energy, aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. However, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve SDG 7.

Challenges such as energy access disparity, overreliance on fossil fuels and infrastructure gaps rank high on the list of barriers to achieving clean energy and affordable energy.

> 📖 To learn more about the main challenges of achieving SDG 7 in the Global South, read Section 2 of this research [article](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/va/d2va00247g#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20a%20decentralized,major%20challenges%20of%20SDG%207.).

The article's authors identified five major challenges to achieving SDG 7 in the Global South. They include:

1. Limiting the use of fossil fuels
2. Migrating towards diversified renewable energy matrices
3. Decentralizing energy generation and distribution
4. Maximizing energy and energy storage efficiencies
5. Minimizing energy generation costs of chemical processes

These challenges are by no means an exhaustive list, but they represent some of the most significant barriers to transitioning to clean energy in Africa and Asia.
