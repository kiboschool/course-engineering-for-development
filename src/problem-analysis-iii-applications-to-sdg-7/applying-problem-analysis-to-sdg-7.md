# Applying Problem Analysis to SDG 7

In this section, we'll continue our exploration of problem analysis, this time focusing on Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7): Affordable and Clean Energy. As you've seen in lessons 6 and 7, problem analysis is a crucial tool for dissecting complex issues and understanding their root causes, which is essential for crafting effective solutions. Just as we applied problem analysis to SDG 6's clean water and sanitation challenges, we'll employ the same principle when addressing energy-related problems within SDG 7.

## Problem Analysis for SDG 7

Now, let's delve into how we can apply problem analysis to the challenges associated with SDG 7.

### 1. Mapping the Problem

First, you will have to map out the key challenges related to clean and affordable energy access. This might include disparities in access, reliance on fossil fuels, energy poverty, and more. You will identify the symptoms of these problems and their manifestations at local, national, and global levels.

> **Meet Alex**
>
> Alex is a young and curious student passionate about clean energy. He lives in a small town called Greenville, where they've been hearing a lot about the need for affordable and clean energy. One day, Alex's teacher assigns a special project: to create an energy map of Greenville to understand its energy challenges.
>
> Alex starts by talking to neighbors, friends, and family. He finds out that some folks in Greenville don't have access to electricity because their homes are too far from the power grid. That's a big red flag on the map! Alex marks it and labels it "Unequal Access to Electricity."
>
> Next, he digs deeper and learns that most of the town's electricity comes from a coal-fired power plant. Burning coal isn't good for the environment, and it's causing air pollution in Greenville. So, Alex adds another spot on the map and names it "Heavy Reliance on Fossil Fuels."
>
> Now, Alex talks to Mrs. Ramirez, an energy activist who runs the local recycling center. Mrs. Ramirez mentions that a lot of people in Greenville don't know about energy-saving practices. They leave their lights on even when they're not in the room, and they use old appliances that guzzle electricity. Alex realizes this is another problem. On the map, it goes: "Lack of Energy Efficiency Awareness."
>
> The energy map is starting to take shape, but there's more to discover. So, Alex organizes a community meeting. People share their concerns, and one issue comes up a lot: high energy bills. Some folks are struggling to pay them, and they're afraid of getting their electricity cut off. Alex jots down "Energy Poverty" on the map.
>
> With the map complete, Alex takes it to the town council meeting. They share what they've learned about Greenville's energy challenges and discuss possible solutions. The town council decides to invest in solar panels for homes in the areas without electricity and launch an energy-saving campaign to raise awareness.
>
> Alex's energy map not only helped identify the problems but also became a valuable tool for finding solutions. It was a reminder that understanding a problem is the first step in making positive changes.

>‚ùì Discussion Question: Can you think of any energy challenges in your community that could be added to the energy map? How might these challenges be addressed?

### 2. Identifying the Root Causes

Just like when we asked the "Why?" questions in Lesson 7, we'll do the same here.

- Why do disparities in energy access exist?
- Why is there such heavy reliance on fossil fuels?

By peeling back the layers, we can identify the root causes behind these challenges.

Energy failures in Africa have been attributed to a multitude of factors, including:

- The inadequacy of personnel training
- Deficiencies in local manufacturing
- Subpar utility performance
- Theft of grid equipment
- Adverse weather conditions
- Unreliable gas supply
- Insufficient funding
- The aging infrastructure of the grid.

> ü™û Reflection: Think about the last time you experienced an electricity problem or an increase in energy bills.
> - What do you think caused this issue?
> - How could understanding the main reasons behind it help us come up with better solutions for similar problems in > the future?

### 3. Stakeholder Involvement

Problem analysis often involves engaging stakeholders. For SDG 7, stakeholders might include governments, energy providers, environmental organizations, businesses, and, importantly, the communities affected by energy challenges. Engaging these parties can provide valuable insights and perspectives.

>‚ùì Read through the story below and identify the stakeholders involved in the energy problem.
>
> **Your Task:** Imagine you're watching this story unfold. Your job is to figure out who the key people and groups are in this town's journey to find better energy. These important folks might not be very obvious, so you'll need to read closely to see how they help make decisions and bring different ideas to the table. Look for individuals and groups who play a part in solving the town's energy problems.

> **A Town's Quest for Reliable Energy**
>
> In a calm town nestled near hills and a winding river, life was simple and peaceful. The people lived closely, and everything seemed perfect. However, there was a big problem - how they got their energy.
> 
> The town depended on an old coal power plant for its electricity. It had worked for a long time, but it had some serious issues: The plant's smoke turned the once-blue sky into a dull, brownish color. Frequent breakdowns left the town in darkness when they needed power the most. People worried that coal energy might not be the best choice anymore because cleaner options were available.
>
> The town's leaders decided it was time for a change. They looked at a green hill near the town and thought it could be the answer to their energy problems.
>
> As the new energy plan started, it became clear that many people and groups were part of it, even though their roles weren't immediately obvious. One person, known for caring about the environment, had the idea for the project. Local craftsmen, who were really good at their jobs, built and installed the energy equipment. A retired engineer in the town, who kept a low profile, used their knowledge to guide the project. Some nature lovers and environmentalists in the town made sure the project wouldn't harm the environment. Parents, worried about their kids' health because of the coal plant, supported the project. Two young activists led campaigns to get more people behind the idea. But there were also quiet supporters among the town's people who attended meetings and voted for the project.

    The Stakeholders involved in solving the town‚Äôs energy problem include;

    1. The "Visionary": There was a person in town known as the visionary, quietly dedicated to environmental causes. They initiated the project and led its initial planning.
    2. Local Craftsmen: A group of local craftsmen was tasked with building and installing the energy infrastructure.
    3. Retired Engineer: A retired engineer, living anonymously in the town, provided valuable technical advice for the project.
    4. Environmental Watchdogs: An informal group of nature enthusiasts and conservationists monitored the project's impact on the surrounding ecosystem.
    5. Concerned Parents: Parents worried about the health of their children due to pollution from the coal plant. They actively supported the change.
    6. Young Activists: A couple of energetic young activists from the town organized awareness campaigns to rally support for the initiative.
    7. Quiet Supporters: Some residents, while not actively involved, silently supported the project by attending town meetings and voting in favor.

In the next section, we'll explore real-world case studies related to SDG 7. These examples will illustrate how problem analysis has been applied to address energy-related challenges in different regions. By examining these cases, we can gain practical insights into the complexities of energy issues and the various approaches taken to tackle them.
