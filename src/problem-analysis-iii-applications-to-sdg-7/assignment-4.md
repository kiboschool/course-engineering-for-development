# Assignment 4

## Assignment Options: Problem Analysis Blog Article or Informational Video

## Background

In this assignment, you will explore critical issues related to water or energy challenges in Africa, specifically aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) or 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). You will conduct a comprehensive problem analysis (using the Pareto analysis or Problem Tree method) of a specific challenge and present your findings either in the form of a blog article or a video (3-5 minutes in length). The goal is to identify the root causes and consequences of the chosen challenge and propose potential solutions or interventions.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Choose a Challenge**
Select a specific water or energy challenge in Africa that aligns with SDG 6 or 7. This could include issues like access to clean water, energy poverty, water scarcity, or inadequate sanitation facilities.

**Step 2: Research** 
Gather qualitative and quantitative data related to the chosen challenge. Utilize a variety of reputable sources, including academic journals, reports from international organizations, and government publications. Ensure that you cite your sources properly, following a recognized citation style (e.g., APA).

**Step 3: Problem Analysis** 
Choose one of the two analysis methods: Pareto Analysis or Problem Tree Analysis, to dissect the selected challenge.
- Pareto Analysis: Identify the most significant factors contributing to the problem. Use the 80/20 rule, where you focus on the 20% of factors causing 80% of the problem.
- Problem Tree Analysis: Create a visual representation of the problem, illustrating the root causes, intermediate causes, and effects. Explore the interconnections between these elements.

**Step 4: Proposed Solutions** 
Based on your analysis, propose potential solutions or interventions to address the identified challenge effectively. Your solutions should be grounded in your analysis and take into account the unique context of the issue.

**Step 5: Video or Blog Article**
Depending on your chosen format (video or blog article), create your content with the following considerations:
- Blog Article: Write a well-structured and engaging article (minimum 200 - 250 words) that communicates your findings effectively. Ensure use utilize the 7Cs of Communication in your post.
- Video: Create a video presentation (3-5 minutes) that concisely conveys your analysis and proposed solutions. Use visuals, narration, and clear communication to engage your audience.

**Step 6: Citations and References**
Include proper citations for all sources used in your work by creating a list of references that match the citations in your work.
