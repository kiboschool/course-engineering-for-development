## Week Overview

Welcome to Lesson 8: Problem Analysis III, the third part of our exploration of problem analysis techniques within the context of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Last week, you learned about clean water and sanitation issues, delving into real-life problems in some African countries and improving your skills in analyzing them. This week, we're applying those skills to a new challenge: energy.

In this engaging and insightful lesson, we will shine a spotlight on SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy, one of the most pivotal goals in the global pursuit of sustainable development. This lesson is structured to deepen your understanding of problem analysis while diving into the complexities of energy-related challenges.

Letâ€™s get started
