## Week Overview

Welcome to Lesson 6 of our Engineering for Development course. In Week 5, we explored the crucial first step in any successful project: problem identification. We learned how to pinpoint the specific challenges within complex systems using the insights gained from systems thinking. Now, in Lesson 6, we take the next step â€“ problem analysis. Here, you will learn the key principles, explore useful tools and techniques, and understand how to uncover root causes and interconnectedness. By the end of this lesson, you'll be well-equipped to analyze complex issues effectively. Let's get started!

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the different levels and importance of problem analysis
- Conduct a comprehensive analysis of social problems using appropriate tools and methodologies.
- Analyze the root causes and drivers contributing to the social problems.
- Derive meaningful insights from stakeholder interactions and data analysis.
