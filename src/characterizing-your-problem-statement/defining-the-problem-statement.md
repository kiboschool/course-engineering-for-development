    1. Identifying the Current Pain: A great problem statement should clearly articulate what the current pain point or issue is. This helps all stakeholders understand the specific problem that the project aims to address.
    2. Outlining Consequences: Understanding the consequences of the problem is vital. A comprehensive problem statement should highlight the potential repercussions, both short-term and long-term, of not addressing the issue promptly.
    3. Providing Background: Context matters. Including some background information about the issue can help stakeholders grasp the historical context and the factors that have contributed to the problem's emergence.
    4. Estimating Costs: A well-crafted problem statement should touch upon the costs incurred due to the problem. This information can motivate stakeholders to support the project.
