In the lecture, Dr Trier-Bieniek explains that a social problem is a broad term that encompasses anything deemed undesirable by a community or society. To understand social problems fully, we need to distinguish between objective and subjective reality. Objective reality acknowledges the existence of an issue, while subjective reality defines it as a problem. This distinction gives rise to social construction, which refers to how society interprets and illustrates current events and issues.

She further asserts that social problems are not meant to remain unresolved. They demand social action for effective solutions. This action can take various forms:

1. **Social Policies:** Laws and programs designed to address social issues.
2. **Social Advocates:** Individuals and groups advocating for change and offering solutions.
3. **Innovation:** Creative approaches to problem-solving that reframe issues and propose novel solutions.

From the article, we learn about a classic definition of social problems given by Hornell Hart in 1923. He  defined a social problem “*as **a problem** which actually or potentially **affects large numbers of people in a common way** so that it may best be solved by some measure or measures applied to the problem as a whole rather than by dealing with each individual as an isolated case, or which requires concerted or organized human action.”*

> ❓ Reflection: How do these definitions of social problems **align** or **differ** from your previous understanding?

## Examples of Social Problems

Here are some examples of social problems:

1. **Economic problems:** These include poverty and unemployment. Poverty can lead to a lack of access to basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare, while unemployment can lead to financial instability and a lack of opportunities for personal and professional development.
2. **Health problems:** These include living conditions and access to health systems, which can negatively impact people's health outcomes. Poor living conditions can lead to exposure to environmental hazards, while a lack of access to health systems can lead to untreated illnesses and chronic conditions.
3. **Political problems,** including immigration and civil rights, can have a significant impact on people's rights and freedoms. Immigration policies can lead to discrimination and marginalization, while civil rights issues can lead to a lack of access to basic rights like voting and equal treatment under the law.
4. **Socio-psychological problems:** These include racism and gender inequality. Racism can lead to discrimination and marginalization, while gender inequality can lead to a lack of access to opportunities and resources.
5. **Educational problems:** A lack of access to education can lead to limited opportunities for advancement and a lack of skills and knowledge.
6. **Environmental problems** such as climate change and deforestation can lead to environmental hazards like extreme weather events, which can have a significant impact on people's lives and livelihoods.

## Characteristics of a Social Problem

As you learned earlier, social problems are conditions or issues that affect a significant portion of society and require collective action for resolution. Hence, it's essential to recognize the characteristics of a social problem. The characteristics of social problems include:

1. **Social Impact:** Social problems have widespread consequences that affect individuals, communities, or society as a whole. These impacts can manifest in various ways, such as economic, social, or cultural.
2. **Value Conflict:** Social problems often involve conflicting values or beliefs within society. Different groups or individuals may perceive the issue differently, leading to debate and disagreement.

1. **Change Over Time:** Social problems are not static; they evolve and change over time due to shifts in societal norms, policies, or circumstances.
2. **Collective Responsibility:** Addressing a social problem typically requires collective action involving various stakeholders, including government agencies, non-profit organizations, and individuals.

## How to Identify and Understand Your Social Problem of Interest

Now that you understand the fundamentals of social problems, it's time to apply this knowledge to identify and understand a specific social problem of interest.

Read about Boma’s journey to learn the steps to guide you.

> **Boma's Journey**
>
> Meet Boma, a passionate and socially conscious university student. Boma has always been deeply concerned about environmental problems, and recently, she decided to take action to address a specific problem within her community.
>
> **Step 1: Choose an Area of Interest:** Boma begins her journey by choosing her area of interest - environmental sustainability. She is particularly interested in the issue of plastic pollution in her coastal community, where plastic waste has been causing harm to marine life and the local ecosystem.
>
> **Step 2: Conduct Preliminary Research:** Boma knows that to make a real impact, she needs to be well-informed. She starts by conducting preliminary research. She reads scientific articles about the effects of plastic pollution on marine life and the environment. She also watches documentaries and reads news reports about similar issues in coastal communities around the world.
> 
> **Step 3: Define the Problem:** After her research, Boma clearly defines the problem: "Excessive plastic pollution is threatening the marine ecosystem in my community, harming the marine life, and negatively impacting the livelihoods of local fishermen."
>
> **Step 4: Contextualize the Problem:** Boma understands that context is crucial. She considers her community's history of reliance on fishing, the cultural importance of the sea, and the economic significance of the fishing industry. This context highlights why plastic pollution is a critical issue in her community.
>
> **Step 5: Analyze Stakeholders**
>
> Boma identifies the key stakeholders involved:
> - Local fishermen and their families
> - Environmental activists and organizations
> - Local government and policymakers
> - The general community
>
> She interviews local fishermen to understand their perspectives, speaks with environmental organizations to gather insights, and researches government policies related to waste management and environmental protection.
>
> **Step 6: Collect Data:** Boma decides to gather data to support her understanding of the problem. She conducts surveys among community members to assess their awareness of plastic pollution. She also collects data on the types and quantities of plastic waste found in coastal areas.
>
> **Step 7: Synthesize Your Understanding:** After months of research, interviews, and data collection, Boma synthesizes her understanding of the issue. She realizes that the problem is multifaceted. The community is aware of plastic pollution, but there's a lack of effective waste management and recycling programs. Fishermen are concerned about declining fish populations due to pollution, and they support initiatives for cleaner oceans.
>
> Through her journey, Boma has not only identified her social problem of interest but has also gained a deep understanding of its complexity and the various perspectives and stakeholders involved. Armed with this knowledge, she is now ready to move forward and create a well-informed problem statement and an action plan to address plastic pollution in her coastal community.
