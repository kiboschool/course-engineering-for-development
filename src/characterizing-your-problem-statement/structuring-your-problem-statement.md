A problem statement provides a clear and concise description of the problem, guiding problem solvers in the development of solutions. It ensures that all stakeholders are on the same page, understanding the problem's nature and scope, which is essential for effective collaboration. A well-structured problem statement also helps in narrowing down the problem's focus, making it more manageable.

Imagine how frustrating it will be for a problem solver if there is no sense of focus and thorough understanding of the problem of interest.

## Structuring a Problem Statement

Just like you learned in Section 9.1, a well-structured problem statement provides clarity and direction for your problem-solving efforts.

   A well-structured problem statement typically consists of several key components:

   1. **Problem Definition:** Start by clearly defining the problem. What is the specific issue or challenge you aim to address? Use precise and concise language to describe it.
   2. **Scope and Boundaries:** Specify the scope of the problem statement. What are the boundaries of the problem? This helps prevent the problem statement from becoming too broad.
   3. **Context:** Provide context for the problem. Explain the background, including historical, cultural, or geographical factors that are relevant to understanding the problem.
   4. **Impact and Significance:** Discuss the impact of the problem on individuals, communities, or society as a whole. Highlight why it is a pressing issue that needs attention.
   5. **Stakeholders:** Identify the key stakeholders involved or affected by the problem. Who are the individuals, groups, or organizations with a vested interest in addressing this problem?
   6. **Constraints and Limitations:** Mention any constraints or limitations that may affect the problem-solving process. This demonstrates awareness of potential challenges.

From the videos, we learned that a problem statement is essentially a concise, clear, and concrete summary of the research problem you aim to address. It should be structured in a way that is straightforward, easy to read, and quickly convey what the problem is, why it's worth researching, and how you intend to approach it.

A problem statement should be structured in such a way that it covers four key areas (addresses these questions)

1. **What Do We Know About the Problem:** Demonstrating a thorough literature review and an understanding of the current state of knowledge.
2. **What We Don't Know About the Problem:** Highlighting research gaps and the contributions your study will make.
3. **Why Do We Need to Know What We Don't Know:** Emphasizing the significance and relevance of your study.
4. **How Do We Want to Know It:** Briefly outlining your research methodology and methods.

To further illustrate the concept of structuring problem statements effectively, let's examine real-world examples of well-structured problem statements from various fields, such as healthcare, education, and computer science.

**Another way to structure your problem statement is to ensure that it includes all of the relevant components. See the examples below.**

### Project 4: Enhancing Digital Financial Inclusion in African Communities

> ***Problem Definition:*** The challenge involves addressing the existing limited access to formal banking and financial services in many African communities, particularly those in rural areas.
>
> ***Scope and Boundaries:*** This project will focus on the development and implementation of a mobile banking application tailored to African communities. It aims to provide access to basic banking services, facilitate digital payments, and offer financial education resources.
>
> ***Context:*** The problem is influenced by factors such as geographical remoteness, limited infrastructure, and disparities in digital literacy levels among the population.
> 
> ***Impact and Significance:*** The limited financial inclusion restricts economic opportunities, perpetuates poverty, and hinders financial transactions and savings for underserved individuals and communities.
>
> ***Stakeholders:*** Key stakeholders include underserved individuals and communities in African rural areas, local banking institutions, regulatory bodies, and community organizations.
>
> ***Constraints and Limitations:*** This project must address constraints such as limited rural internet access, regulatory considerations, and the need for widespread adoption of the mobile banking application among the target population.

The problem statement can also be written without the bullet points in a personalized manner like this:

> The challenge that drives my project is the pervasive lack of access to formal banking and financial services in numerous African communities, especially those situated in remote rural areas. My project is dedicated to the creation and implementation of a tailored mobile banking application designed specifically for the unique needs and circumstances of African communities. The primary objectives of this application are to grant individuals access to essential banking services, streamline digital payment processes, and offer comprehensive financial education resources. This challenge is deeply influenced by the geographical remoteness of these communities, which often hinders access to traditional banking infrastructure. Additionally, disparities in digital literacy levels across the population further compound the problem. The limited financial inclusion in these areas acts as a significant barrier, obstructing economic opportunities and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Moreover, it hampers the ability of underserved individuals and communities to engage in secure financial transactions and savings. The success of my project hinges on the collaboration and engagement of key stakeholders, including the underserved individuals and communities residing in African rural areas who will benefit from improved financial access. Additionally, local banking institutions, regulatory bodies, and community organizations will play pivotal roles in this endeavor. To effectively address this issue, my project must navigate numerous challenges, such as limited rural internet access, regulatory considerations that vary across regions, and the necessity of ensuring widespread adoption of the mobile banking application among the target population.

A problem statement can also be written in simple language, as shown below:

> I want to help people in African communities, especially in rural areas, who don't have easy access to banks or financial services. I'm working on making a special mobile banking app for them. This app will let them do basic banking stuff, like sending money and paying bills using their phones. It will also teach them about money. This problem is mainly because these places are far away from cities, and not everyone knows how to use digital technology. It keeps people poor and makes it hard for them to use money safely. People who care about this are the folks in these rural areas, the banks, the government, and some groups trying to help. But we face challenges like slow internet in these areas, rules that are different in different places, and making sure everyone in these communities can use the app.

These three variations of the problem statement on enhancing digital financial inclusion in Africa all have the same key components.
