Present the findings in a well-structured report, highlighting the significance of understanding diverse perspectives in problem identification.

**Week 8: Problem Analysis (15%)**

In this assignment, you will explore critical issues related to water or energy challenges in Africa, specifically aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) or 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). You will conduct a comprehensive problem analysis (using the Pareto analysis or Problem Tree method) of a specific challenge and present your findings in either a blog article or a video (3-5 minutes in length). The goal is to identify the root causes and consequences of the chosen challenge and propose potential solutions or interventions.
