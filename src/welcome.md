## Course Description

In Engineering for Development, you will learn how to analyze the root causes of development challenges so that you are able to build effective technology solutions. The course aims to introduce you to selected global development challenges using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as the framework for selecting the areas of focus.

Each term, the course will focus on 1- 2 subject areas (e.g., Quality Education, Affordable and Clean Energy, Climate Action), which will serve as test cases for you to develop the skills required to effectively analyze and understand complex development issues. You will examine the system-level dynamics that are at the root of these challenges and will also analyze and critique technology-related solutions that have been developed to address these challenges.
