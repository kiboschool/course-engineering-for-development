From the video, we learned that research articles are valuable sources of information. The information in these articles can help you better understand and articulate your problem of interest. You can find good research articles from a number of sources:

- **Academic Libraries:** Most colleges and universities have extensive databases of scholarly journals and research articles. Check your institution's library website for resources.
- **Online Databases:** Consider using databases like PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for comprehensive searches.
- **Open Access Publishers:** Platforms like Plus PLoS offer a wide range of open-access research articles.

Websites are also common sources of information. However, not all websites are reliable. Use these criteria to evaluate websites:

- Recency: Is the website up-to-date?
- Relevance: Does the website relate to your topic?
- Authority: Who authored the page, and are they affiliated with reputable institutions?
- Accuracy: Can the information be verified and independently reviewed?
- Purpose: What is the website's intended purpose, and are there any biases or advertisements?

So what happens after you find an article that is relevant to your problem of interest?

The next thing is to read it effectively by following these steps:

- Start General: Begin by reading the title, abstract, and headings to get an overview of the article.
- Skim Introduction and Conclusion: Review the introduction and conclusion to understand the big picture.
- Define Unfamiliar Terms: Look up any unfamiliar terms to ensure comprehension.
- Examine Tables and Figures: Pay attention to tables and figures as they help you understand the collected data.
- Analyze Methods and Results: Focus on variables measured, hypotheses, and study findings.
- Read Again: Reading the article multiple times can help you absorb all the information effectively.

A literature review is essentially a comprehensive summary and analysis of existing research on a particular topic. In your context, a good literature review can serve 3 important functions:

1. Identifying existing knowledge about the problem: They help you discover what is already known about your chosen topic. This is crucial as it prevents you from duplicating research that has already been conducted.
2. Providing critical insights: Literature reviews offer a critical evaluation of existing research related to the problem. By examining methodologies, findings, and arguments, they allow you to assess the quality and validity of previous studies.
3. Identifying Gaps in Knowledge: One of the key benefits of a literature review is pinpointing gaps in current knowledge. This provides an opportunity for you to contribute something original to your field of study.

**Here are the steps involved in conducting a literature review:**

Step 1: Search for relevant literature on your topic in this case the problem of interest

Step 2: Evaluate and select sources

Step 3: Identify themes, debates, and gaps. As you read through your selected sources, it's crucial to take notes and identify the following elements:

- Trends and patterns in theory, methodology, or results.
- Key themes addressed across various sources.
- Debates or contradictions among different studies.
- Influential studies that have shaped the field.
- Gaps or areas where further research is needed.

Step 4: Outline your literature review's structure. The structure of your literature review can vary depending on what you discover during your research and your specific objectives. There are four common approaches used to organize the literature:

- Chronological: Organize sources from older to more recent publications.
- Thematic: Group sources based on key themes or topics.
- Methodological: Compare and contrast research methods used in different studies.
- Theoretical: Discuss opposing theories or models

Step 5: Start writing. This involves writing the introduction, main body and conclusion to sum up the main points, discuss the implications of the literature, and suggest areas for future research.
