# Final Project

## Group Project (SDG 6 or 7 Solution Evaluation) 20 points

For the final group project, your task is to evaluate existing solutions related to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) or SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). 

Working in your groups, select a real-world intervention or project that aims to address water and sanitation challenges (SDG 6) or promote clean and affordable energy access (SDG 7) in a specific context within Africa. Your evaluation will focus on assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of the chosen solution based on provided criteria.

## Overall Project Guidelines

- Solution Selection: Choose one intervention addressing water, sanitation, or energy challenges aligned with SDG 6 or 7.
- Case Study Analysis: Evaluate the intervention's effectiveness and impact on SDG targets.
Sustainability Assessment: Analyze the project's long-term sustainability and its contributions to the environment, society, and the economy.
- Data Collection: Gather qualitative and quantitative data from reports, research articles, interviews, and surveys.
- Critical Review: Compare findings with other relevant research to inform your assessment.
- Recommendations: Provide evidence-based suggestions to enhance the solution's effectiveness and sustainability.
- Final Presentation: Prepare your evaluation and recommendations as a 6-8 minute video. Each member of the group must contribute to the presentation.

## Detailed Project Instructions

### Project Instructions
**1. Solution Selection:**
