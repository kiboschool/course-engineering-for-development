## Week Overview

Welcome to Lesson 5 of our Engineering for Development course. In this lesson, you'll be learning about problem identification, which is an essential first step in any successful project. As you recall from Week 4, where we explored system thinking and its applications, understanding the interconnectedness of factors in complex development issues is crucial. This understanding will now serve as a foundation as we delve into problem identification. Just as systems thinking helps us see the bigger picture, problem identification helps us zoom in on specific challenges within that system. Let's apply what we've learned about systems thinking to identify real-world problems effectively.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Identify different types of problems
- Understand the importance of problem identification
- Employ techniques and methodologies to identify and define social problems accurately, considering their root causes and underlying complexities.
