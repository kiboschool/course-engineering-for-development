# Applying Systems Thinking Tools

There are many different systems thinking tools available, but two of the most common are systems mapping and scenario modeling.

## Systems Mapping

Systems mapping is a visual tool that helps us understand the relationships and dependencies within a system e.g socio-ecological system. By representing components and their interactions graphically, we can identify key leverage points for intervention. Tools like causal loop diagrams and stock-and-flow diagrams aid in mapping the causal relationships between social and ecological elements.

Systems mapping can be used to represent a system at any level of complexity, from a small group to a global ecosystem. The key is to identify the key components of the system and the relationships between them. Causal loop diagrams and stock-and-flow diagrams are two common types of systems maps.

From the video, we learn that there are two notable ways to use a systems map namely

- **Retrospective Use:** For program evaluation, systems maps compare the system's state at distinct junctures, unveiling its evolution and identifying areas of improvement.
- **Prospective Application:** In program design, systems maps provide a proactive lens, revealing relationships, feedback loops, and dependencies. This knowledge empowers the identification of strategic leverage points that can initiate systemic change.

## Scenario Modeling

Scenario modeling involves creating different scenarios to explore how changes in one aspect of the system might impact its dynamics. Each scenario is based on different assumptions about the future, such as changes in technology, climate, or economic conditions. This tool helps decision-makers anticipate potential outcomes and make informed choices. For instance, we might model the effects of policy changes on both the livelihoods of local communities and the health of surrounding ecosystems.

In the video, the narrator says that scenarios are more than just predictions. They are stories that explore the complexities of the future. They help us to understand the present moment and to think about possible future outcomes.

The key to scenario modeling is to focus on the present reality. We need to consider the different stakeholders involved, each with their own interests and preferences. By understanding these complexities, we can identify possible deviations from existing trends.

For example, let's say we are interested in understanding the future of the global climate system. We could create scenarios that explore different possible future states of the system, such as a world with more extreme weather events or a world with less ice in the Arctic. By understanding the different factors that could influence the future of the climate system, we can identify possible deviations from existing trends and develop strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change.

By utilizing tools like systems mapping and scenario modeling, we can gain insights into these systems that are essential for making sustainable and informed decisions in a world where the fates of human societies and natural environments are intricately intertwined.
