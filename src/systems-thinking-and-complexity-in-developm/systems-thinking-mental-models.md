# Systems Thinking Mental Models

🗣 “What you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And, with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.”

> 📺 Let’s begin by learning what a mental model is. Watch this explainer video for an introductory overview.

From the video, we learn that a mental model is an explanatory framework, a concept, or a worldview that resides within the mind, aiding in the interpretation of the world and the interconnection between various elements.

> 🪞 Reflection: Have you ever had a situation where your mental model was wrong? What happened? How did you adjust your thinking?

Systems thinking mental models in this context are a powerful tool for understanding complex systems. They can help us to see the interconnectedness of the parts of a system and how changes in one part can affect other parts of the system.

Can you recall the six mental models referenced in the video?

1. **Non-Linear Organization:** This mental model embraces the idea that elements feed into one another in cycles, creating intricate webs of influence. It acknowledges that actions, events, and components interact in ways that often defy straightforward categorization.*

2. **Stock & Flow:** This model condenses complexities into two core components: stock and flow. Stock refers to the entities within the system that can be added or subtracted – tangible elements like animals, plants, money, and resources. Flow, on the other hand, represents the actions that influence the stock, such as transactions, exchanges, and transformations.*

3. **Iceberg Model**: This introduces a multi-layered approach to understanding reality. At the surface, we encounter events – observable occurrences that often distract us from deeper insights. Delving deeper, we encounter patterns of behavior that unfold over time, revealing recurring trends. At the systemic level, we unearth the underlying structures that give rise to these patterns. Finally, we reach mental models – the assumptions, beliefs, and values that shape our perceptions and actions.*

4.**Bottleneck:** According to this model, the bottleneck is the point where delays and inefficiencies accumulate and it determines the system's overall performance. Identifying and addressing bottlenecks is essential for optimizing system functionality.*

5. **Second-Order Thinking**: This level of thinking helps us anticipate outcomes and navigate complexities more adeptly.*

6. **Feedback Loop:** This model shows how actions can lead to unintended consequences and how these consequences can then lead to further actions. This is because complex systems are often nonlinear, meaning that small changes can have large consequences. Additionally, feedback loops can create reinforcing loops, which amplify changes, or balancing loops, which dampen changes.*

At its core, these mental models offer you the insight to dive deep into complex systems. They empower you to uncover the causes and effects that often remain hidden, anticipate how changes in one part impact the whole and identify pivotal points where interventions can lead to transformative outcomes.

> 🪞 **Reflection Question**: Think about a complex development issue you've encountered, either on a global or local scale. How could applying systems thinking help you gain a deeper understanding of the issue and potentially identify more effective solutions?
