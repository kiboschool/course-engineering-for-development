# Introduction to Systems Thinking

<aside>

🗣 “By fixating on parts of the system, we miss understanding the whole.”
**- S. Gross**

</aside>

Systems thinking is a holistic approach that recognizes the interconnectedness of elements within a larger system. Rather than focusing solely on individual components, it looks at how these components interact and influence one another. This section introduces you to the fundamental principles of systems thinking and its significance in the context of development.

> 📺 Watch this video for an introductory overview of systems thinking.

In the video, the speakers made reference to the family (the archetypal system) and school systems, respectively. Systems thinking is not limited to administrative structures; it is a lens through which we can see the intricate tapestry of interconnectedness that shapes our lives

## Definition of System Thinking

<aside>

🗣 “Systems thinking is a perspective of seeing and understanding systems as wholes rather than as collections of parts. A whole is a web of interconnections that creates emerging patterns.”
**– Peter Senge**

</aside>

The term "systems thinking" was initially coined by Barry Richmond, who described it as "the art and science of making reliable inferences about behavior by developing an increasingly deep understanding of underlying structure."

> 📖 For a deeper perspective, refer to section 3 of Ross Arnold and Jon Wade’s [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915002860).

> 📺 Watch the Computer Science Education Research video on systems thinking.

In their work, Ross and Jon examined multiple definitions of systems thinking from various authors. After careful consideration, they synthesized it to signify "a set of synergistic analytical skills used to enhance the capacity for identifying and comprehending systems, forecasting their behaviors, and formulating adjustments to achieve desired outcomes."

It's important to note the following key aspects:

- Systems thinking is both an art and a science.
- It comprises a collection of analytical skills.
- It revolves around understanding the intricacies of the system.

> 🪞 **Reflect**: Imagine if you could combine the creative thinking of an artist with the structured approach of a scientist to understand complex problems. That's what systems thinking is all about. How do you think using this dual approach could help you tackle the intricate challenges you might encounter in your studies or future job?

## Fundamental Concepts in System Thinking

The fundamental concepts are the building blocks of systems thinking. They guide the way we perceive and analyze complex systems, whether they're ecological ecosystems, social structures, or technological networks. By understanding the fundamental concepts of system thinking, we can better understand how systems work and how they can be changed.

> 📖 Read Leyla Acaroglu’s [article](https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-6-fundamental-concepts-of-systems-thinking-379cdac3dc6a) on the six fundamental concepts of systems thinking where she shares key insights and tools needed to develop and advance a systems mindset for dealing with complex problem-solving.

From the article, we learn about six important concepts in systems thinking, namely;

- **Interconnectedness:** Everything is interconnected. This means that everything in a system affects everything else in the system. For example, a change in the weather can affect the economy, which can affect the environment, which can affect the health of people, and so on.
- **Synthesis:** Systems thinking is about seeing the big picture. It is about understanding how the parts of a system fit together and how they affect each other. This requires us to synthesize information from different sources and to see the connections between seemingly unrelated events.
- **Emergence:** The outcome of the synergies of the parts. It is about non-linearity and self-organization. This means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. For example, a flock of birds can exhibit complex behavior that is not present in any individual bird.
- **Feedback loops:** Feedback loops are a key concept in systems thinking. They can be either positive or negative. Positive feedback loops amplify change, while negative feedback loops dampen change. For example, a positive feedback loop can lead to an economic boom, while a negative feedback loop can lead to an economic recession.
- **Causality:** The traditional view of causality is that one event causes another event. However, in systems thinking, causality is more complex. Events can be caused by multiple factors, and the effects of an event can be delayed or amplified by feedback loops.
- **Systems mapping:** This is a tool that can be used to visualize systems and to understand the relationships between the parts of a system. It can be helpful for understanding how systems work and how they can be changed.

> 🪞 **Reflection**: Think about your morning routine before coming to class.
> - How are different parts of your routine connected? For instance, how does waking up late affect your breakfast, and how does that impact your mood in class?
> - Share your thoughts on how things are linked together in your routine. Can you identify any loops where one thing affects another, and it comes back around?
> **Discuss on Padlet and see if your colleagues have similar experiences.**

## Significance of System Thinking

Systems thinking is a powerful approach that offers several important advantages in understanding and addressing complex issues.

> 📺 Watch the ESSGR video on “Why is systems thinking important and when can it help us?”

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jcbUknMEm40" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

From the video, we learn that the crux of systems thinking lies in its relevance to solving complex problems. Benefits of system thinking include:

1. **It can help us to make sense of complex and intricate scenarios.** By understanding the interconnectedness of systems, we can see how seemingly unrelated events are actually connected. This can help us to avoid feeling overwhelmed by complexity and instead see it as an opportunity for discovery.
2. **It can help us to predict the consequences of our actions.** By learning the patterns and behaviors within a system, we can see how our actions will affect other parts of the system. This can help us to make better decisions and to avoid unintended consequences.
3. **Systems thinking can help us to identify risks and vulnerabilities.** When we consider the system as a whole, we can see where there are potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This can help us to take steps to mitigate these risks and protect the system from harm.

In 2022, the Editorial team at Indeed (the popular job posting platform) published an [article](https://sg.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/systems-thinking) about systems thinking, emphasizing the advantages it brings. According to the team, systems thinking enables us to:

- **Explore New Opportunities:** Systems thinking helps us identify unexpected opportunities by considering the broader context and connections within a system.
- **Minimize the Impact of Mistakes:** By understanding the interdependencies in a system, we can anticipate potential consequences and minimize the negative impacts of mistakes.
- **Make Realistic Plans:** Systems thinking aids in creating plans that are more aligned with the intricacies of real-world systems, increasing the chances of successful outcomes.
- **Repair Broken Designs:** When issues arise, systems thinking assists in pinpointing the root causes of problems, facilitating effective solutions that address the underlying design flaws.

In essence, systems thinking serves as a valuable tool for comprehending intricate systems and making informed decisions. It holds relevance in tackling a wide array of challenges, ranging from addressing climate change and poverty to improving healthcare systems.
