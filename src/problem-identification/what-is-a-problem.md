🗣 "It isn't that they cannot find the solution. It is that they cannot see the problem."
**– G.K Chesterton**

> ❓ **Discussion**:  What is a problem?
> On the Padlet below, share how you would define a problem in your own words.

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/96zi22h1b0gxfysn" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:708px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

A problem has been defined in a number of ways. Let’s learn some notable ones.

> "A problem is a gap between an existing state and a desired state."
> **- Thomas J. Watson, Jr., former CEO of IBM**

> "A problem is a question to which the answer is not immediately known."
> **- George Polya, mathematician and educator**

> "A problem is a situation that prevents us from achieving our goals."
> **- Steven Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People**

> "A problem is a challenge that requires us to think creatively and strategically."
> **- James Altucher, entrepreneur and author**

> “A problem is something that is difficult to deal with or something that is a source of trouble, worry”
> **- Britannica Dictionary**

> "A problem is an opportunity in disguise."
> **- Albert Einstein, physicist**

Do you see the pattern of association? One author considers the problem to be a **question**, another calls it a **challenge**, and Einstein viewed it as an **opportunity**.

These definitions all emphasize the importance of understanding the difference between the current state and the desired state. They also highlight the need to think creatively and strategically in order to solve problems.

From the video, we learn that there are five elements of a problem, namely:

- **Problem solver:** The person or group of people who are trying to solve the problem.
- **Controlled variables:** The factors that the problem solver can change in order to affect the outcome of the problem.
- **Uncontrolled variables:** The factors that the problem solver cannot change in order to affect the outcome of the problem.
- **Constraints:** The limitations that the problem solver must work within in order to solve the problem.
- **Possible solutions:** The different ways that the problem solver can try to solve the problem.

> ❓ **[Scenario Based Activity] Networked Server Mystery**
>
> In a computer science context, a networked server used for critical research is facing unpredictable periods of inaccessibility. As a student, can you spot the following elements related to the problem:
>
> "Amidst your research institute's computer network, a server essential for AI research occasionally becomes inaccessible without any apparent cause. This issue is disrupting ongoing experiments and causing concerns among researchers who depend on the server. Your task involves investigating and resolving this problem. As a computer science student, you need to ensure that the AI research server remains available while considering budget constraints and the existing network setup."

> Identify these five elements within the scenario:
> - Problem Solver
> - Controlled Variables
> - Uncontrolled Variables
> - Constraints
> - Possible Solutions

<details>
   <summary> Answer </summary>
   
   - Problem Solver: Computer science student*
   - Controlled Variables: Factors under control like investigation techniques, server configuration adjustments*
   - Uncontrolled Variables: Unknown causes of server inaccessibility, researchers' reaction to disruptions*
   - Constraints: Budget limitations, existing network infrastructure*
   - Possible Solutions: Identifying server issues, proposing efficient server configurations, troubleshooting network disruptions*

## Steps to Identifying a Problem

> 📺 Watch this mini-lecture by Francis Fukuyama to learn about the steps involved in problem identification.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cuHWMUbW-kA?si=aPSKWbp-MCDAh6xK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Francis enumerates four key steps to identifying a problem, namely:

1. **Explore the problem.** This involves understanding the problem in its entirety, including its causes, effects, and context. This can be done by gathering information from a variety of sources, such as stakeholders, experts, and data.
2. **Consult with stakeholders.** This is important to get different perspectives on the problem and to build consensus on the way forward. Stakeholders can include individuals, organizations, or groups that are affected by the problem or that have an interest in solving it.
3. **Build a causal map.** This is a visual representation of the causes and effects of the problem. It can help to identify the root causes of the problem and to develop solutions that address them.
4. **Define the problem's scope.** This involves determining the boundaries of the problem and the resources that are available to solve it. It is important to set realistic goals and to focus on the most important aspects of the problem.

## How to Define a Problem

After reading various definitions of a problem and reflecting on the one that resonated most with you, you will discover that problems are all around us. It is how we define them and how we respond to them that determines if they remain as obstacles or stepping stones for us.

> 📖 Read the Part 1 and 2 of the WikiHow [article](https://www.wikihow.com/Define-a-Problem) on how to define a problem.

From the article, we learn the necessary steps to take in order to properly define a problem

Step 1: Ask “why” to get to the heart of the problem

Step 2: Identify what you already know about the problem

Step 3: Figure out what other information you need

Step 4: Do research to fill in the gaps

Step 5: Describe the problem in your own words

Step 6: Expand your initial statement with more details

Step 7: Discuss the statement to determine if it could be stronger

Step 8: Define the key terms used in the problem statement

We will elaborate more on steps 5-8 in lesson 9, where the focus will be on characterizing your problem statement.

> ❓ Let’s discuss. Imagine that you are a community leader in a city that is experiencing a high crime rate. You have been tasked with leading a discussion on how to define and address the problem. What are some of the key questions that you would want to ask the participants in the discussion? Share your thoughts here and give feedback on a peer’s question.
