Historically, the public sector has played a central role in financing development efforts. Governments allocate funds, gather revenue through taxation, and direct resources toward initiatives geared toward societal advancement. Although the government's role remains essential, the substantial funding needed for the SDGs prompts inquiries into whether the public sector alone can bear this obligation.

Aside from the financial constraints, there are other challenges that pose as barriers to the attainment of the SDG. They include:

- **Persistent Inequalities:** Despite advancements, disparities in income, access to education, and healthcare persist. Addressing these inequalities is vital for achieving the SDGs.
- **Environmental Threats:** Climate change and environmental degradation pose significant threats to sustainable development, affecting livelihoods, ecosystems, and vulnerable communities. Mitigating and adapting to these changes is crucial for achieving many SDGs.
- **Political Complexities:** Achieving the SDGs necessitates global cooperation. Overcoming political differences and establishing effective governance mechanisms can be complex.
- **Data Gaps:** Accurate data is fundamental for tracking progress. However, many regions lack robust data systems, making it challenging to monitor advancements accurately.
