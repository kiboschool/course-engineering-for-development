## Examples of SDGs in Action

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a global framework for addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges. Here, we explore compelling real-world instances that showcase the SDGs in action, translating lofty aspirations into tangible impact.

### Goal 2: Zero Hunger (Zero Hunger Initiative: Transforming Nairobi’s Food Landscape)

> 📺 Watch this documentary to see how the Zero Hunger Initiative aims to transform the urban food systems in Nairobi, Kenya by 2050.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fkvTAiQX28c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

From the video, we learned that the initiative caters to diverse groups within the community, including people with disabilities and those engaged in community media. Following training, participants choose their specific agricultural pursuits, ranging from crop farming to livestock rearing.

- Crop Farming: Employing innovative techniques such as vertical and exact gardening, participants yield crops in confined spaces, maximizing productivity.
- Hydroponics: This water-based system fosters vertical farming by nourishing plants with essential nutrients. Hydroponics emerges as an efficient solution for producing food in limited spaces.
- Poultry Farming: Addressing both meat and egg production, select groups delve into poultry farming, enhancing the availability of protein-rich sustenance.

By promoting sustainable agricultural practices, this initiative aligns with SDG 2's objective of ending hunger, improving nutrition and achieving food security.

### Goal 3: Good health and wellbeing (OMOMi: Bridging the maternal health gap with digital technology)

> 📖 Read the National Health Watch **[article](https://articles.nigeriahealthwatch.com/omomi-is-leveraging-digital-technology-to-provide-women-with-easy-access-to-quality-maternal-health-care/)** about OMOMi, an app using technology to help women easily access good maternal healthcare. Think about how this initiative relates to SDG 3, which aims to ensure good health and well-being for everyone.

The program officer for OMOMi, Onyedikachi Nwizu, rightly noted that “Tools like the OMOMi app can help provide the much-needed data that government and other stakeholders can work with to improve outcomes and protect women from preventable deaths”

> 🪞 **Reflection:** Considering the interconnected nature of the SDGs, what other Sustainable Development Goals might be positively impacted by digital technology initiatives like OMOMi?

### Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities (Curitiba, Brazil: A model sustainable city)

Consider the city of Curitiba in Brazil. They've pioneered a unique and efficient public transportation system that reduces traffic congestion and air pollution. By creating dedicated bus lanes and implementing a smart card payment system, they've made it convenient and eco-friendly for people to use public transport. This initiative aligns perfectly with SDG 11's vision of creating cities that are not only sustainable but also safe, inclusive, and well-planned for future generation

> 📺 Explore further insights from Prof. Semida Silveira as she discusses sustainable solutions to address the urban challenges faced by Curitiba in this video.

## The Relevance of the SDGs to Social Entrepreneurship

Now that you've seen real-world examples of sustainable development goals in action, it's clear how these goals go hand in hand with entrepreneurship – especially social entrepreneurship. These goals are all about making positive changes in the world, which is at the core of what social enterprises aim to do.

> 📺 Watch the UNDP video on Sustainable Development Goals and your Business to learn about how SDGs are relevant to social entrepreneurship.

From the video, we learn that there are several ways in which social entrepreneurs can apply the SDGs. First, the SDGs provide a clear framework for social entrepreneurs to focus their efforts. The 17 goals cover a wide range of social and environmental issues, and social entrepreneurs can use the SDGs to identify the problems they want to address.

Second, the SDGs offer a roadmap for achieving social impact. The goals are ambitious, but they provide a clear path for progress. Social entrepreneurs can use the SDGs to develop strategies for achieving their goals and measuring their impact.

Third, the SDGs provide a platform for collaboration. Social entrepreneurs can work together to achieve the SDGs, and they can use the goals to build partnerships with governments, businesses, and other organizations.
