## Week Overview

Welcome to the final week of our Engineering for Development Course, Week 10! This week is all about fine-tuning your problem statement, which is like the compass guiding your learning journey at Kibo. You've laid the groundwork in Lesson 9, where you learned to define your problem statement with precision. Now, in Lesson 10, we'll build upon that foundation. We'll dive deep into the art of refining, taking the research and insights you've gathered over the weeks and molding them into a crystal-clear, concise, and well-structured problem statement.

Once you've polished your problem statement, Section 10.2 will show you how to present and defend it like a pro. Effective communication of your problem statement is key to getting support from important stakeholders. We'll explore various techniques to not only convey your refined problem statement but also defend it eloquently when questions come your way. Remember, your problem statement is your ticket to solving real-world issues effectively.

In Section 10.3, we'll take a moment to reflect on your journey. Think about how you've grown personally and professionally throughout this course. What new skills and knowledge have you gained? How can you apply them in your engineering career? It's not just the end of a course; it's the beginning of a path where your abilities as a problem solver can make a big difference.
