# Case Study 2: Tharaka, Kenya - A Quest for Water Security

Tucked away in the heart of Kenya, Tharaka County boasts breathtaking landscapes and a vibrant culture. However, beneath this picturesque exterior, a significant challenge has been unraveling – the battle for water security. In recent years, Tharaka has found itself in the grip of a severe water crisis, a complex issue that has far-reaching implications for the community.

Tharaka's struggle for water security is not merely a singular problem but a web of interconnected issues. The primary culprits behind the region's water scarcity are erratic rainfall patterns, unsustainable agricultural practices, and insufficient water infrastructure. To truly grasp the depth of the issue, we turn to Fishbone Analysis, a powerful problem analysis technique.

## Fishbone Analysis - Uncovering the Root Causes

**Step 1: Draw the Fishbone Structure (Ishikawa Diagram):**

Begin by drawing a horizontal line across your page, resembling a fishbone spine. This spine represents the main problem – in our case, water scarcity in Tharaka, Kenya.

**Step 2: Identify Categories (Branches):**

Extend several diagonal lines from the spine, like ribs on a fishbone, each representing a category contributing to the problem. In Tharaka's case, these categories are:

- Environment
- Technology
- Human Factors
- Infrastructure
- Economy

**Step 3: Identify Factors (Bones):**

Now, on each branch, identify specific factors that contribute to the category's role in the problem. For instance:

- Under Environment, list "Erratic Rainfall Patterns," "Deforestation," and "Land Degradation."
- Under Technology, mention "Lack of Modern Irrigation" and "Inadequate Water Storage."
- Under Human Factors, include "Population Growth" and "Agricultural Practices."
- For Infrastructure, list "Poor Infrastructure" and "Inefficient Water Management."
- Under Economy, note "Economic Dependence on Agriculture."

**Step 4: Ask "Why" for Each Factor (Bones):**

For each factor (bone), delve deeper by asking "Why" multiple times to uncover root causes. For example:

For "Erratic Rainfall Patterns," ask, "Why are rainfall patterns erratic?" The answer may include climate change and shifting weather patterns.

Continue this process for each factor, peeling back layers of causation.

**Step 5: Analyze Interconnections:**

As you go through this process, you'll notice interconnections between factors. For instance, unsustainable agricultural practices (Human Factor) can intensify the effects of drought (Environment) and cause a reduction in agricultural productivity (Economic). These interconnections reveal the complexity of the problem.

**Step 6: Reflection:**

Fishbone Analysis aids in understanding the intricate web of causes behind Tharaka's water scarcity. It shows that solving this issue demands a comprehensive strategy that addresses environmental, technological, human, infrastructural, and economic aspects.

Now that we've applied Fishbone Analysis to the Tharaka water crisis, consider what other aspects of this challenge you would explore using problem analysis techniques and why these aspects are essential for gaining a holistic understanding of the issue. Think about the potential solutions that might emerge from this analysis and how they could bring water security to Tharaka.
