# Case Study 3: Sanitation Challenge in Ghana

Ghana, a country known for its rich culture and warm hospitality, faces a daunting problem that affects its environment and population significantly - pollution and sanitation issues. In this case study, we will employ the Problem Tree Analysis technique to delve into the root causes, consequences, and potential solutions to these pressing problems.

The sanitation challenge in Ghana has persisted over the years, manifesting in unsightly heaps of trash, clogged gutters, and improper disposal of fecal matter and plastic waste. A recent UNICEF report revealed that only 21% of Ghana's 30 million population have basic access to sanitation, highlighting the gravity of the situation.

## Problem Tree Analysis - Uncovering the Root Causes

**Step 1: Draw the Problem Tree:**

Begin with a vertical line at the center of your page, representing the core problem - sanitation issues in Ghana. Branch out horizontally from this line, creating the tree's roots.

**Step 2: Identify Causes (Roots):**

Extend branches downward from the roots to identify the underlying causes contributing to the sanitation problem. In Ghana's case, these root causes are:

- Policy and Institutional Challenges: Inadequate sanitation policies and weak institutional enforcement hinder effective sanitation management. Policies might lack clarity, and enforcement mechanisms may be weak.
- Sanitation Financing: Insufficient funding and financial mechanisms limit sanitation project implementation and infrastructure maintenance.
- Rapid Urbanization: The rapid growth of urban areas strains existing sanitation infrastructure and services due to increased demand.
- Lack of Upkeep and Maintenance: Sanitation projects often lack sustainable maintenance plans, leading to the deterioration of facilities.

**Step 3: Ask "Why" for Each Cause (Root):**

Dig deeper into each root cause by asking "Why" multiple times to unveil the core issues. For example:

For "Policy and Institutional Challenges," ask, "Why are policies inadequate?" The answer may involve ineffective governance and insufficient enforcement.

Continue this process for each root cause, revealing the layers of causation.

You can share your further analysis on the other root causes (sanitation financing, rapid urbanization, lack of maintenance) on the Padlet below.

**Step 4: Identify Consequences (Fruits):**

Extend branches upwards from the main problem to identify the consequences or "fruits" of the sanitation problem in Ghana. These consequences include:

- Health Risks
- Economic Loss

**Step 5: Ask "Why" for Each Consequence (Fruit):**

Probe deeper into each consequence by asking "Why" repeatedly to uncover the broader impacts. For instance:

For "Health Risks," ask, "Why does inadequate sanitation lead to health risks?" The answer may involve the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera.

Continue this process for each consequence, unraveling the complexities.

**Step 6: Analyze Interconnections:**

As you explore causes and consequences, recognize the interconnections between them. For example, "Lack of Upkeep and Maintenance" contributes to both inadequate sanitation infrastructure and economic loss.

Through Problem Tree Analysis, we've revealed that Ghana's sanitation challenge is deeply rooted in policy and institutional challenges, sanitation financing issues, rapid urbanization, and a lack of upkeep and maintenance. These root causes lead to health risks and economic losses, painting a grim picture of the problem's scope.

>❓ **Reflection Activity:** Now, consider how a comprehensive approach that addresses these interconnected issues could help Ghana overcome its sanitation challenges. Reflect on potential solutions that might emerge from this analysis, and how they could lead to a cleaner and healthier Ghana.
