From the video, we learned that a case study can be defined as a method for developing a thorough understanding of a process, program, event, or activity. Case studies serve as a robust approach to investigating and researching various topics, integrating both quantitative and qualitative information from diverse sources.

**Case studies can generally be categorized into three types:**

1. **Exploratory Case Studies:** These aim to define the questions and hypotheses for subsequent studies. They involve in-depth research and analysis to explore a topic thoroughly. For example, examining the successful operation of a welfare program in a specific state can lead to further research on implementing similar programs elsewhere.
2. **Descriptive Case Studies:** They provide a comprehensive description of an event within its context. They emphasize the nuances and specific details of the example being examined.
3. **Explanatory Case Studies:** Explanatory case studies focus on establishing cause-and-effect relationships. They seek to explain why certain outcomes occur as a result of specific circumstances. For instance, one might investigate the effects of eating before swimming under different conditions.

In the following sections, we will consider descriptive and explanatory case studies related to SDG 6 in Africa.
