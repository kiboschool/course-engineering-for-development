# Case study 1: Water Scarcity at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka

The University of Nigeria is a leading university in Nigeria, with a student population of over 50,000. However, the university is facing a serious problem: water scarcity. The water supply on campus is unreliable, and the water that is available is often dirty and contaminated. This makes it difficult for students to maintain good hygiene and stay healthy.

Here are some of the challenges that students face due to water scarcity:

- They have to spend hours every day collecting water.
- The water that is available is often dirty and contaminated.
- They have to use the dirty water for cooking, bathing, and laundry.
- They have to store water in containers, which can be a fire hazard.
- The water scarcity is a major inconvenience and stressor for students.

**Let‚Äôs apply the root cause analysis to analyze this problem**

**Step 1: Mapping the problem**

The problem of water scarcity in the university is already established. Symptoms of the problem include water shortages on campus and dirty/contaminated water sources.

**Step 2:** ¬†**Asking "Why?"**

Following the principles of root cause analysis,¬† let's ask the ‚Äú5 Whys‚Äù for a clearer understanding of the root causes of water scarcity at the University of Nigeria:

- **1st Why:** Why is there water scarcity at the University of Nigeria?
    - **Answer to 1st Why**: There's water scarcity because the region's geological factors make accessing clean water difficult.
- **2nd Why:** Why do geological factors in the region make accessing clean water difficult?
    - **Answer to 2nd Why:** The geological factors include rock formations and mineral deposits, especially coal, that limit groundwater availability and affect water quality.
- **3rd Why:** Why do these geological factors limit groundwater availability and affect water quality?
    - **Answer to 3rd Why:** These geological features restrict the flow of groundwater due to their dense composition and may introduce impurities like minerals from coal deposits into the water.
- **4th Why:** Why do these geological features exist in the region?
    - **Answer to 4th Why:** These geological features are natural occurrences in the region's landscape and have developed over millions of years.
- **5th Why:** Why hasn't this issue been resolved despite these geological factors being known?
    - **Answer to 5th Why:** Resolving geological challenges is complex and may require substantial resources, technology, and sustainable water management strategies.

**Step 3: Identifying the root cause(s) of the problem**

By using these "5 Whys," we've uncovered that geological factors, including rock formations and coal deposits, are among the root causes of water scarcity at the University of Nigeria. This analysis deepens our understanding of why this issue persists and underscores the need for comprehensive solutions.

Steps 4 and 5 will involve proffering solutions to the problem, implementing them, and monitoring the solution to assess the impact. For this course, we will focus on the analysis of problems.

>‚ùì Reflection: In addition to the "5 Whys" method, what other problem analysis technique might you apply to this case study, and why do you think it would be valuable in gaining a deeper understanding of the water scarcity issue at the University of Nigeria?
