# Applying Problem Analysis to SDG 6

Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure access to clean water and adequate sanitation for all by 2030. This is a complex challenge, and problem analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the challenges and developing solutions.

As you learned in lesson 6, problem analysis is a systematic approach to identifying and understanding the root causes of a problem. It involves gathering data, identifying the different factors that contribute to the problem, and developing a theory of change that explains how these factors interact to produce the problem.

Problem analysis can be used to inform a wide range of interventions, from policy development to program design. In this context, it can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing interventions for clean water and adequate sanitation.

> ü™û Reflection Question: In your opinion, what do you think is the most challenging aspect of achieving SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) in your country? Why do you find it challenging, and what role can problem analysis play in overcoming it?

## Understanding the Scope

The first step in applying problem analysis to SDG 6 is to understand the scope of the problem. This involves assessing the current state of water and sanitation in a given region. Questions to consider include:

1. **Access**: Who has access to clean water and sanitation facilities, and who doesn't? Are there specific groups or communities that are disproportionately affected?
2. **Quality**: Is the available water safe to drink, or is it contaminated? What is the state of sanitation facilities in terms of hygiene and functionality?
3. **Infrastructure**: Are there adequate water sources, distribution systems, and sewage infrastructure in place? Are these systems well-maintained
4. **Policy and Governance**: What are the policies and regulations related to water and sanitation in the region? How effective are they in ensuring access and quality?

From the article, we learn that scoping a problem is the process of understanding the current state of the problem and defining the desired outcome. This helps to create a working model of the problem and identify the key stakeholders. An actionable problem statement is one that is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.¬† It should also include the criteria for success, the constraints, and the plan for when the problem is solved. You will learn more about this in lesson 9.

> üì∫ Watch the following video for more insight on how to scope problems.

To scope a problem, you can use the following steps:

- Define the problem.
- Identify the stakeholders.
- Gather data.
- Analyze the data.
- Define the desired outcome.
- Create an actionable problem statement.

> ‚ùì Discussion Activity: When scoping an SDG 6 project aimed at providing clean water access in a rural African community, should the initial focus be on conducting comprehensive needs assessments to fully understand the community's challenges, or should the emphasis be on immediate action and implementation to quickly address water scarcity issues? Defend your stance with evidence and reasoning.

## Identifying Root Causes

Once you've assessed the scope, the next step is to identify the root causes of water and sanitation challenges. This involves digging deeper to understand why these problems exist.

Possible root causes might include:

- **Lack of Infrastructure:** Inadequate infrastructure can lead to water scarcity and poor sanitation. Identifying where infrastructure is lacking is essential.
- **Poverty:** Economic factors can limit access to clean water and sanitation. Poverty alleviation measures might be necessary.
- **Environmental Factors:** Pollution, climate change, and ecosystem degradation can impact water quality and availability.
- **Policy Failures:** Ineffective policies, corruption, or mismanagement can hinder progress toward SDG 6.

## Stakeholder Analysis

Understanding the stakeholders involved in water and sanitation issues is crucial. This includes governments, local authorities, NGOs, communities, and private sector entities. Stakeholder analysis helps identify who can contribute to solving the problems and who might obstruct progress.

> üì∫ Watch this documentary about the water crisis in South Africa and identify key stakeholders involved in the challenge.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jVZhMQkTtU?si=IWchu24ul84GzPUw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

From the documentary you saw earlier, you can see that there were a number of stakeholders. Can you mention them?

**The stakeholders involved in the water crisis in South Africa include:**
- *Community members/residents: These are the people who are most directly affected by the water crisis. They are the ones who have to deal with the lack of water, and they are the ones who will benefit the most from any solutions that are implemented.*
- *Technical specialists: These are the people who have the knowledge and expertise to help solve the water crisis. They can provide advice on how to improve water infrastructure, how to conserve water, and how to educate the public about water conservation.*
- *Media reporters/journalists: These are the people who can help to raise awareness of the water crisis. They can report on the issue and its impact on the community, and they can help to put pressure on the government to take action.*
- *Water truck operators: These are the people who provide water to communities that do not have access to it. They can help to alleviate the immediate problem of water scarcity, but they are not a long-term solution.*
- *Government authorities: These are the people who have the power to make decisions about water policy. They can allocate funding for water projects, they can regulate water use, and they can enforce water conservation laws.*
- *It is important to engage all of these stakeholders in the process of addressing the water crisis. By working together, they can develop solutions that are effective and sustainable.*

**In addition to the stakeholders mentioned above, there are also other stakeholders who may be involved in the water crisis in South Africa. These include:**
- *NGOs: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can play a role in providing water to communities, educating the public about water conservation, and advocating for better water policies.*
- *Private sector entities: The private sector can provide water infrastructure, water treatment services, and water conservation products.*
- *International organizations: International organizations can provide funding for water projects, technical assistance, and training.*

By understanding the different stakeholders involved in the water crisis, we can better understand the challenge and develop solutions that are more likely to be successful.
