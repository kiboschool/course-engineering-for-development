# Wrap Up

Congratulations on completing the second part of our journey into problem analysis!

In Lesson 7, we delved into Problem Analysis II, exploring real-world case studies related to SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation. We applied various problem analysis techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and root causes associated with water and sanitation issues in different African countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya. Through these case studies, we sharpened our problem-analysis skills, enabling us to identify crucial insights into complex global issues.

As we wrap up Problem Analysis II, it's important to remember that our journey through the Sustainable Development Goals is not over. In Lesson 8, we will transition to Problem Analysis III, where we will shift our focus to SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy. We will continue to employ problem analysis techniques to dissect case studies and explore the challenges and opportunities within the realm of energy access and sustainability.

Throughout this course, we've emphasized the critical role you play as future scientists and problem solvers. Your commitment to understanding complex issues and seeking innovative solutions is paramount in addressing the global challenges outlined in the SDGs.

In Lesson 8, we'll dive into the world of clean and affordable energy. Together, we will analyze real-world cases, apply problem analysis techniques, and work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

See you in Lesson 8: Problem Analysis III!
