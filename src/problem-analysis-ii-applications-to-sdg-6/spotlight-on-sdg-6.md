In Lesson 2 of this course, you were introduced to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that lay out a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. This week, our focus turns to the sixth goal, which is particularly fundamental and interconnected with many aspects of human well-being: SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation.

## Understanding SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

>❓ Discussion: How important is clean water to you in your daily life, and how do you think access to clean water impacts communities, especially in regions where it's scarce? Share in the Padlet below

<div style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);border-radius:2px;box-sizing:border-box;overflow:hidden;position:relative;width:100%;background:#F4F4F4"><iframe src="https://padlet.com/embed/q5tyhmjs3pu8i7hs" frameborder="0" allow="camera;microphone;geolocation" style="width:100%;height:708px;display:block;padding:0;margin:0"></iframe></div>

SDG 6 aims to ensure access to clean water and adequate sanitation for all by 2030. It addresses a pressing global challenge: the scarcity, unequal distribution, and often polluted state of our water resources. Water is essential for life, health, food security, and the environment. However, billions of people still lack access to safe drinking water, and sanitation facilities remain inadequate in many regions.

> 📺 To understand SDG 6 better, watch the following video to learn about the SDG 6 targets and indicators.

From the videos, we learned that SDG 6 has eight targets, namely;

**Target 6.1:** By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.

**Target 6.2:** By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

**Target 6.3:** By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.

**Target 6.4:** By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity.

**Target 6.5:** By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate, as a way to improve water security and to reduce water-related natural disasters.

**Target 6.6:** By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes, to substantially increase their contribution to water supply and food security, for human health, livelihoods, and decent work, and to reduce disaster risk, and contribute to adaptation to climate change.

**Target 6.7:** By 2030, substantially increase the number of people who have access to information and awareness for the sustainable management of water at all levels.

**Target 6.A:** Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management.

**Target 6.B:** By 2020, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water-related activities and programs, in particular water-scarce areas and those affected by droughts and floods.

## **The Importance of SDG 6**

Clean water and sanitation are foundational to achieving many other SDGs. For instance, access to clean water is critical for good health (SDG 3), while sanitation is closely linked to improved living conditions and dignity (SDG 1 and SDG 10). Clean water is essential for agriculture (SDG 2) and ecosystems (SDG 15), and sustainable management of water resources is key to combating climate change (SDG 13). Therefore, SDG 6 is not only a goal in itself but also an enabler for achieving broader sustainable development.

Here's why SDG 6 matters:

1. **Basic Human Right:** SDG 6 recognizes clean water as a fundamental human right, essential for health and well-being.
2. **Rising Demand:** With a growing global population, the demand for water increases, impacting health, poverty, food security, and crisis response.
3. **Water Scarcity:** Addressing water scarcity is central to SDG 6, demanding innovative water management and conservation.
4. **Treating Polluted Water:** Cleaning polluted water is vital for public health, relying on advanced water treatment technologies.
5. **Sanitation and Hygiene:** Access to sanitation and hygiene prevents disease spread, particularly in crowded areas.
6. **Innovation: Technology**, especially in water treatment, is crucial for achieving SDG 6 goals.

>🪞 Reflection Activity: Think about your daily routine. How would it change if you didn't have access to clean water or proper sanitation? What challenges would you face, and how might it affect your overall well-being?

## Challenges and Complexities

Despite the importance of SDG 6, achieving it poses significant challenges. Rapid urbanization, pollution, climate change, and unequal access to resources all complicate efforts to ensure clean water and sanitation for everyone. In this section, we'll explore these complexities and learn how problem analysis techniques can help unpack the multifaceted issues surrounding SDG 6.

> 📖 Read the [highlights](https://sdg.iisd.org/news/africa-report-finds-slow-progress-on-clean-water-energy-urbanization/) from the Africa Development Bank report on the challenges of achieving SDG 6 in the continent for better context.

The report highlights that while there have been improvements in access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation in Africa, the progress remains relatively low compared to global standards. This is despite Africa, excluding North Africa, receiving significant official development assistance (ODA) for water supply and sanitation. Moreover, there exist substantial disparities both between different countries in Africa and within individual countries themselves. For instance, North Africa generally exhibits higher access rates compared to other regions on the continent. The availability of safely managed drinking water sources ranges from 100% in Mauritius to as low as 19% in Eritrea. Additionally, there's a noticeable urban-rural divide, with 82% of the urban population having access to basic drinking water services compared to only 43% of the rural population. The report underscores several emerging challenges that pose threats to achieving SDG 6, including the impacts of climate change, recurring droughts, floods, and the effective management of water resources.
